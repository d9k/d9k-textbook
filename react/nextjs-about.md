- [Next.js - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next.js)

Next.js was first released as an open-source project on GitHub on October 25, 2016.

It was originally developed based on six principles:
- out-of-the-box functionality requiring no setup
- JavaScript everywhere
- all functions are written in JS
- automatic code-splitting
- server-rendering
- configurable data-fetching
- anticipating requests
- simplifying deployment.
