# Test-driven development

## Reasoning

Testing is not exactly the most fun thing we can do in development.
But you know what’s even less fun than testing?
That’s right, debugging.
If only there was a way to anticipate bugs and errors in our code before it actually happens. That would save us so much time and stress that we can use in other parts of our life.
That’s where Test-Driven Development comes in to save the day.

## Why tests called `.spec.*`?

:thinking_face: Возможно потому что тест со спецификацией того, что он тестирует, более новый стандарт, чем "классические" тесты:

> A spec, short for specification, comes from behavior driven testing, and encourages the mindset where you are defining 'what' the software does.
>
> Calling it a test leads to a much more general way of thinking about the code, and does not reinforce the idea that you should be testing the interface (instead of the implementation) as well.
