Testing is not exactly the most fun thing we can do in development.
But you know what’s even less fun than testing?
That’s right, debugging.
If only there was a way to anticipate bugs and errors in our code before it actually happens. That would save us so much time and stress that we can use in other parts of our life.
That’s where Test-Driven Development comes in to save the day.

making the code easier to maintain and refactor. You can change your code and be assured that it still works by verifying that the tests run successfully.

It is also a best practice to use red, green, and refactor commit formats.

Functional programming is programming that relies on pure functions. Pure functions don’t rely on external state or variables, don’t cause side effects or alter external variables, and always return the same result for the same input. I like to think of them as programming’s answer to a scientific control. As such, they are ideal for unit testing and this article has a very good takedown of the benefits
