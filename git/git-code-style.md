# git: code style

## Past or imperative?

https://www.danclarke.com/git-tense

Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz" instead of "[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "[I] changed xyzzy to do frotz", as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change its behavior.

Is the message predominantly for other people, typically reading at some point before they have assumed the change: A proposal of what taking the change will do to their existing code.

Stick with the present tense imperative because

* it matches tickets in the bug tracker which naturally have the form "implement something", "fix something", or "test something."
