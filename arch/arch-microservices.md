# Architecture: microservices

## Microservices advantages

- Since each microservice runs independently of the others, itâ€™s easy to add, remove, update, and scale individual microservices without disrupting other services. You can focus on only necessary services in case of an increased load.
- When developing microservices, developers can use any programming language and any framework for each new microservice.
- Improved fault tolerance. If one microservice fails, the other services can keep working, leaving the app mostly unaffected.
## Microservices disadvantages

- Communication between microservices can be complex. If you have multiple microservices, you might need to write extra code to maintain smooth communication and avoid disruptions.
- Large infrastracture
- Each service needs to be tested independently and verified before the application as a whole can be tested.
