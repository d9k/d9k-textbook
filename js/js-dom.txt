# JS: DOM

## What is the difference between reflow and repaint

- _Repaint_ occurs when changes are made which affect the visibility of an element, but not its layout. Examples of this include
	- outline
	- visibility
	- background color

- _Reflow_ involves changes that affect the layout of the whole page or a portion of the page. Reflow can be triggered by
	- resizing the browser window
	- changing the font
	- content changing (such as user typing text)
	- using JavaScript methods involving computed styles
	- adding or removing elements from the DOM
	- changing an element's classes

Reflow of an element causes the subsequent reflow of all child and ancestor elements as well as any elements following it in the DOM.
