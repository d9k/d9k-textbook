# JS: CORS

## What is same-origin policy

The same-origin policy is a policy that prevents JavaScript from making requests across domain boundaries. An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. This policy is enabled by default and prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page using Document Object Model(DOM).
