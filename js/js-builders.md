# JS: Builders

### В чём разница между Snowpack и Vite?

«One of the main differences: #Vite handles both dev and bundle in the same package, using #Rollup. #Snowpack delegates to plugins using #webpack/#parcel. The advantage is that #Vite produces smaller bundles and makes it easier for plugins to tweak dev and build at the same time.»
