# Html: tags

## Semantic tags

Semantic HTML tags clearly describe their meaning to the browser, developer and user. Examples include tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`, which indicate the type of content they contain. Non-semantic tags, on the other hand, don't convey any meaning about their content. They are generic containers used for styling or layout purposes.

The `<input>` tag is used for creating input fields. It's semantic because it defines a specific type of data entry, like text, password, checkbox, etc. So it tells both the browser and the developer what it's used for.

## Non-semantic tags

The `<div>` tag is a generic container used for grouping content and applying styles. It doesn't have any semantic meaning, making it a non-semantic tag.
