# Productivity

## Answer by Mayo

* Avoid gold plating - do only what is asked of you (in terms of requirements)
* Understand business requirements and do it right the first time
* Thoroughly understand your environment and tools
* Become a fantastic typist, use keyboard shortcuts instead of the mouse
* Take an iterative approach and build in sanity checks to ensure you are on the right path
* Don't reinvent the wheel, consider reusing past work and the work of others
* Eliminate distractions, don't keep checking email, looking outside, talking to coworkers, etc.
* Don't overwork yourself - recognize when you need to take breaks

Many, many people strive for "ultimate" quality at the expense of something that is (a) simple, (b) reliable and (c) correct.

The most important way to speed up your development is to simplify what you are doing so that it is absolutely as simple as possible.

"red, green, refactor":

1. Write a failing test (red). (Often for functionality your code does not yet have.)
2. Commit horrible coding crimes to get your tests to pass (green). Hardcode if necessary.
3. Refactor, probably breaking tests for a short while, but overall improving the design.
